<h3> Maddie Robinson's Portfolio</h3>

<main> 
<p> My name is Maddie Robinson, and currently I am a first year Database Administration Student at NSCC. Just last year I graduated from Lockview Highschool with high honors,
and during my time at Lockview I was not sure what to do when I graduated like most students. Finally I came to the decision to come here to NSCC and study Information Technology,
which I've found to be a good choice. 
</p>

<p>So far I am enjoying my course, and with my interest being in database, my favorite classes that I am currently taking are Transactional
 Database Programming, Intro to Linux, and I am growing an interest in Web Design. NSCC is a great school and I am looking forward to what the future holds.  
 This portfolio will include the following:
