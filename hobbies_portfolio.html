<p><h3> Soccer </h3> 
Since I was the age of 5 I have loved the game and played it ever since. 
I am 18 now and am still playing whenever I can as it is a good form of exercise and I love
playing the game, it makes me happy to play and watch. My favorite professional soccer team would be
Manchester United, as my whole family is a big supporter and now so am I. School can be a very stressful thing, 
so it is a great thing to have something to relieve that stress and do something that I really enjoy.

<h3>Exercise </h3> 
Just like Soccer, going to the gym or any form of exercise is a great stress reliever and something
I really enjoy doing whenever I can.

<h3>Traveling</h3> 
I love to travel whether it is near or far. Once a year my family and I take a trip to 
Florida for usually 2 weeks. Its nice to get away especially when it is to somewhere sunny. If I cant go anywhere far, 
then i like to take day trips such as; Peggys Cove, in the summer i drive to Moncton with my friends to go to 
Magic Mountain, go to national Parks, the Valley, etc.
