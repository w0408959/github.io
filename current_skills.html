<p> <h3>Communication Skills</h3> 
Things like school, and especially work have helped me to learn to communicate with others. When I was 
working at Shoppers Drug-mart for 2 years, I was a cashier where I had to communicate with customers all day, and once I was a cosmetician
I had to not only communicate but try and sell the customer products as a part of my daily sales goals. Before my job there I would say that
I wasn't the best at communicating, however now I am quite comfortable with it.

	<h3>IT experience through coursework</h3>  
Although only having a year of IT experience, It has been an intense year
and I can definitely say that I know alot more than i did coming into this course.

		<h3>Organizational skills</h3> 
I am a very organized person and like the space around me to be
clean, tidy, and well organized all of the time. I Strongly dislike cluttered and it can be hard to focus in 
an unorganized environment.
