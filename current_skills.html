<p> <h3>Communication Skills</h3> For a good portion of my life I was quite the introvert and still can be, 
however coming into college has really broadened my social skills as well as my job at Shoppers Drug-mart for the past 2-3 years. 
I can now say I am a very social person.

		<h3>IT experience through coursework</h3>  Although only having a year of IT experience, It has been an intense year
and I can definitely say that I know alot more than i did coming into this course.

		<h3>Organizational skills</h3> I am a very organized person and like the space around me to be
clean, tidy, and well organized all of the time. I Strongly dislike cluttered and it can be hard to focus in 
an unorganized environment.
